## Udacity Project Dog Classification
This project from the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Programme deploys the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in PyTorch to classify dog breeds.

- PyTorch
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Data augmentation
- OpenCV pre-trained face detectors (haarcascades & lbpcascade)
- Pre-trained VGG-16 convolutional network
- Transfer Learning

## Getting started
Open `dog_app.ipynb` on a jupyter notebook environment, or Google colab. The notebook consists of further technical details.

## Future Improvements
Deploys the CNN dog classifier model as a flask or django web application
